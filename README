GENERAL

This package contains the D-FLAT Debugger in version 0.15, 

The D-FLAT Debugger is a tool for visualization and inspection of 
algorithms specified in D-FLAT. In particular, it features:
- Visualization of the tree decomposition and itermediate 
  results (item trees), interactive inspection of extension 
  pointers, and representation of solution candidates.
- Search for solution candidates and (auxiliary) items, including 
  search by specifying regular expressions.
- Debugging on basis of node types assigned to nodes in the item trees. 
  With this, pruned item paths can be inspected, thereby easing to 
  locate the point during the traversal of the decomposition where a 
  solution candidate was discarded.

The D-FLAT system is available at: http://www.dbai.tuwien.ac.at/proj/dflat/system/

COMPILING

There is no need to compile. However, the tool requires
- Python 2, and
- GTK+ >= 2.24.

USAGE

In order to run the debugger, D-FLAT has to provide machine-readable debugging 
information. This is achieved by calling D-FLAT with the parameter --output machine. 

A typical debugger call is of the following format:

./dflat --output machine -p problem.lp < instance.lp | python DflatDebugger.py

In order to reuse the output of D-FLAT for several debugging sessions, one may dump the output to a file:

./dflat --output machine -p problem.lp < instance.lp > dump.dbg
python DflatDebugger.py < dump.dbg
